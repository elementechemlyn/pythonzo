## Monzo API - Work in Process

Documentation to follow!

python runserver.py

Starts a flask app to get an oauth token and store it in the monzosettings.json file. Hit http://localhost:5555/ to start the process.

Once that settings file is made the api can be used from the command line if required. A confidential app will store a refresh token too.

See quicktest.py for an example of using the api.

## Todo
* Improve this readme
* Add some comments
* Make some tests
* Do setuptools config
* Add logging
* Make some interesting pages for the web app
